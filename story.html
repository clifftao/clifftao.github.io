	<p>Zima is a fictional character first appeared in short works by Alastair Reynolds, published in 2006. In 2019, an episode of Netflix's new
		TV series "Love, Death, and Robot" presented the animation of Zima and his story.
	</p>
	<p>Zima is a universe-wide famous artist who started his career in portrait painting. However, Zima soon realized his passion does not lie
		in portraits, so he turned to paint stars and galaxies, entering the second phase of his art life and begin to gain reputation. Towards the end of this period, Zima presented
		the world a paint of an universe with a square of blue settled right in the middle. Ever since then, each piece made by Zima would
		have some geographical shape of blue on it, and the size of which grows larger overtime.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although the world appreciated the so called Zima blue after its astonishing debut, no one knows the reason behind such paint. Zima, being the only exception, did not explain until
		his final piece of art -- himself. Turns out, Zima is not a person, despite his human appearance. On the other hand, he was a robot innitially created for pool cleaning. And Zima blue,
		is his first impresion of the world (through cleanin pools). His whole life was in search of life-meaning and his origin. At last, he detached all of his human-like parts, and retured
		to his prototype -- a domestic cleaning robot.
